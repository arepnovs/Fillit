# Fillit
Recursion sometimes very slow(

Fillit does not consist of recoding Tetris, even if it’s still a variant of this game.
Your program will take a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos and
arrange them to create the smallest square possible. Obviously, your main goal is to
find this smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite a exponentially growing
number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
Then, you will have to think carefully about your data structures and your solving
algorithm, if you want your program answers before the next millenium.
